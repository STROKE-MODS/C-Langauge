// Q. The question is what will be the solution of 3.0+1
// Lets write the code

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    float a = 3.0;
    int b = 1;
    printf("The Addition of A and B is : %f\n",a+b);
    return 0;
}

// It is coming out to be 4.0000 thus an float type because when we add float and int the result will always came out to be float.
